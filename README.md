Bank credit analysis

This is my first approach to machine learning tools during my master's degreee and also is my first time coding. 
It will be used one of the many availables techniques, in this case Logistic Regression.
It is seem reasonable this tool because the Y response is binary and we have to make a predictor selection which it will be easier with regression toolbox.

The work intented to follow the cours of PennState about DataMining (https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat857/node/215) 

It is achieve a better accuracy over the test data compare with the course's example. (Analysis can be seen in the excel sheet)

Accuracy (50% treshold)=72.6 % |||
Accuracy (75% treshold)=69.0 %

About the code: 
The work is not complety and it can be improve a lot. But it was an opportunity to test and try plots, tools and different analysis with real data.
